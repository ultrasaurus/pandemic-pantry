# pandemic-pantry
list of delivery places I like

## Tried and True
* Dried Beans, Rice, Flour, Dried Fruit, Nuts & Chocolate: https://nuts.com/
* Spices, Canned Veggies, pantry items, tp, paper towels, chips: https://www.vitacost.com/
* Citrus: https://www.pearsonranch.com/ -- lovely oranges and lemons
* Fruit: https://www.froghollow.com/ -- wonderful avocados
* Coffee subscription: https://bluebottlecoffee.com/
* Alcohol delivered from local stores by local merchants: https://drizly.com/
* Special pantry items + cheese: https://www.igourmet.com/  (cheese came with reusable cold pack)

## Also...
* lot of small farms sell on Etsy -- though sometimes slow to deliver.  This is where I found ginger and garlic
* ebay for hard-to-find pantry items

## Not so good
* Boxes of Eden -- friendly customer service, arrived on time, but produce was ugh.  Bananas arrived smooshed, celery was wilted (ok for soup), brocoli was yellow with some kind of rot. Carrots were fine.
* hand sanitizer â€” took forever to get here, didn't realized it ships from China! -- https://www.tiddlytotsstore.com/
