# Red Lentil Soup

1 large onion
2 medium carrots
2 cups red lentils
8 cups water
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 tsp salt


Chop onion and carrots (big chunks are fine) and sautee in large pot (until onions are soft or slightly browned).  

Add lentils and water.  

Bring to a boil, then turn down heat and simmer until smooshy (about 20 minutes).

Blend (in small batches, usually easier with blender half-full).

Add lemon juice 1/4 cup at a time, until you can just taste a little sour.

Add salt 1/2 tsp at a time until you can really taste the lemon.

Add a splash of lemon or sprinkle of salt as needed.
